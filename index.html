            Whether you like it fried, roasted, 
            baked, or added to a soup, tofu is an 
            excellent source of protein (it contains 
            all nine amino acids, making it a complete protein), iron,
            calcium, magnesium, and zinc. <br><br>

            <p id="pa">Spinach & Goat Cheese Stuffed Chicken wrapped in bacon drizzled in balsamic glaze with tons of fresh basil. 
               Cut this up and add it to a salad or serve for a simple dinner.

            <p id="pa"> Chef Bun Cheam helmed the kitchen before the pandemic, 
                bringing flavors from Cambodia as well as around Southeast Asia to the menu. 
                So while you could get a traditional lobster roll, the go-to was Cheam's Spicy Essex Bao which featured lobster claw, 
                brown butter and sriracha.
